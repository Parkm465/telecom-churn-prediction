# Customer Churn Prediction (IBM Telecom Dataset)
## Defining The Problem
In busineess, customer churn, the rate at which customers stop using a product, is a major challenge. This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a client is likely to leave based on demographics, services used, and billing information from the dataset. The goal is not only to achieve a strong predictive performance, but also to identify key factors that drive churn and translate model results into actionable businesss insights.
